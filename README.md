This is a reading project, that I have taken up in my summer break of 2020 as a part of the **Summer Of Science IIT Bombay**. Every progress related to the project will be hosted here. The intial order of upload will be haphazard.

    Here, you can find the summarized version of this [paper](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/papers/zeilerECCV2014.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjcsrbOzPToAhVt7nMBHV9GAlYQFjAQegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw3ga-MmEmZLvVUSuQhiPog8&cshid=1587303221548), by **Matthew D. Zeiler and Rob Fergus from the Dept. of Computer Science, New York University, USA** which mainly explores the novel way of **Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks** through *DeConvNets*.

4. **[Gesture Detection CNN Models Using Transfer Learning](https://github.com/sudoRicheek/Gestures-CNN-Model-Creation-And-FineTuning)**

    The above, repo hosts some of the notebooks and stuff that I had created while making the **CNN** Transfer Learning models for this project.

5. **[FINAL REPORT](https://github.com/sudoRicheek/NeuralNetworks-And-DeepLearning-SoS/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning%20Final%20Report.pdf)**

    This is the Final Report PDF for this **Reading Project**.
